### About:
My portfolio website showcasing my progress as a web developer.

### Approach:
PHP is used alongside the front-end in-order to add logical programming to the static pages. A couple examples used here are includes for implementing reusable sections to each page such as the header and footer, as well as storing and executing code chunks based on given variables assigned to each page.

jQuery was incorporated for ease and versatility with adding visual effects and an interactive UX.
