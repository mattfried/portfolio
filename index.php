      From the moment I first logged <i>“Hello World”</i> to the browser, I’ve been captivated in the world of programming...
    </p>
    <p>
      By day I am currently a Structural Engineering Technician at Wolfrom Engineering Ltd, a structural consulting engineering firm in Winnipeg, MB, but by night I am a Web Developer.
      A few years ago, I realized that my heart wasn't invested in the engineering field any longer, and so I started looking for a career change.
      My passion for technology led me into web development, and I grew to love it more than I could have expected!
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for coding is fed my continually learning and improving through each engaging challenge I face, in order to deliver detailed, high-quality web-apps.
      I am currently looking for a full-time Front-End Developer position in the Edmonton, AB area, as this is where my family is planning on, and ready to relocate to.
